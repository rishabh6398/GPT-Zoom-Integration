# GPT-Zoom-Integration
This GitHub project aims to develop a Zoom bot using Node.js that provides an integrated solution for speech-to-text conversion, text generation using GPT, and text-to-speech conversion. The bot is capable of joining Zoom meetings when provided with a meeting link and performing the following steps:

Joining Zoom Meetings:
The bot is implemented using Node.js and leverages the Zoom API to authenticate and obtain an access token. It can then use the provided meeting link to join Zoom meetings programmatically. The bot joins the meeting using a unique name and is capable of entering meetings with a password.

Speech-to-Text Conversion:
During the Zoom meeting, the bot utilizes speech recognition capabilities through the integration of the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text service. It captures the audio input from the meeting and converts it into textual representation in real-time. This functionality enables the bot to transcribe and process the spoken content during the meeting.

GPT Text Generation:
The transcribed text from the Zoom meeting is passed into the OpenAI GPT-3 model for further processing. The GPT model generates a response based on the input text, providing natural language generation capabilities. This step allows the bot to understand and respond contextually to the meeting participants' spoken content.

Text-to-Speech Conversion:
The generated text response from the GPT model is then converted into speech using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech service. The bot transforms the generated text into an audio file in MP3 format. The resulting audio response can be played during the Zoom meeting, allowing participants to hear the bot's generated response in a human-like voice.

The project provides a comprehensive solution for building an interactive bot that actively participates in Zoom meetings, transcribes spoken content, generates contextually appropriate responses using GPT, and plays them back as natural-sounding speech. The integration of speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities enhances communication and interaction within Zoom meetings, making them more inclusive and accessible to all participants.

The project's codebase includes the necessary dependencies, libraries, and configurations required for Zoom API integration, speech recognition, GPT text generation, and text-to-speech conversion. It provides a ready-to-use solution that can be easily deployed and customized according to specific requirements. Additionally, comprehensive documentation and examples are provided to assist developers in understanding and extending the functionality of the bot.
