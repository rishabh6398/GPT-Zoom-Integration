  "description": "Symbl APIs for external consumers. api-client provies an interface for applications to perform the analysis on row text or audio data and get insights from it. The API automatically detects sentence boundaries and punctuates the sentences and returns the updates messages in the response. Conversations are the most unstructured piece of information that we represent information in and leads to a lot of loss of information by not being able to capture them correctly. Symbl's API's focus on understanding such texts and generate the useful and important imformation from them. Currently8 the API supports the detection of Action Items in any type of unstructured text. In the future, the same API will also have support to detect information and events where information is any informational piece and Event is a reference to something that has happened in the past. Symbl can currently integrate with two types of telephony endpoints: SIP and PSTN.",
